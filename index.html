    <h3 class="paddingt fontt padding largetext paddingfinal">A bit About Me</h3>
    <p class="paddingl links padding fontt">Every since I was a little 10-year-old boy, I have always been interested in programming and computers and just overall how it all worked. I never really had someone to guide me or point me into the right direction until just about a year ago. I found out that one of my friends was a Software Developer and joined a boot camp to get to where he is today! I got super interested into how he worked and what he did and I just fell in love with the idea of day dreaming of me becoming a Developer myself. He also mentioned how you're not going to always be by yourself and that 99 percent of the time you working in a team focused on trying to make what ever project you're working on better, and knowing that you're almost always working with others and getting different points of views from other developers, either more or less experienced than you is just amazing. I honestly can not wait to finish this boot camp to make the world a better place.</p>
